- As given in the description, the audio given contains a name inside it
- To decode that audio I used audio decoder audacity  and in files I selected the audio
- Then I searched in youtube how to use audacity to decode audio to find the name 
- By right click and after that decoding that I got an image
- When I searched about it in google and I found that his name is Steven He
- I converted that name into flag format
