# U_4r7

- I did a research about what actually uart is and how does it work.
- Uart contains two main lines they are Transmit (TX) Line and Receive (RX) Line
- From the hint given connect two to TX and three to RX
- This we should connect from hardware device to logic analyzer

- Now install Salae then check digital signals with that we will get the flag
- Place that flag in given flag format
