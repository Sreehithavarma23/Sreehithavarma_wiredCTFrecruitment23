# Ain't no sunshine!
`Embedded`

- According to the description, build the circuit with the help of circuit diagram
- In that circuit diagram we have 3 pins in which one is connected to A0,other one is connected to ground,last one is connected to 5v

- Now in that hardware devive we are given 3 pins to connect and one small device which has inputs and output
- Connect these wires from arduino to potentiometer
- After this connect the hardware device to laptop via USB
- Now when we open Arduino IDE we get encrypted flag we should decrypt that and place in flag format.
# Flag - wired{...}
