# ÂµPython_flag
`Embedded`

- Firstly I went through the description and searched about ESP8266
- Then I got to know that ESP8266 is wifi module which enables micro controllers to connect to wifi network and creates basic wifi applications
- Then I used google to know what actually is Arduino IDE and how to install and connect
-  I connected the hardware device to laptop via USB
- After installing Arduino IDE afer that I add the ESP8266 board manager URL and installed the relevant board package
- Then I selected the appropriate board as arduino uno and COM port as com port 6 USB as it flashed there , then upload your code to the ESP8266.
- I opened serial monitor to see output and debug
- Now i used basic python code to print variable in that
- After this I found the flag in encrypted form so I decrypted that and submitted the flag
- I placed that in the given formate
- flag- wired{...}
